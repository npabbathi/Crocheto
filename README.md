# The purpose of this repository
This repository stores my personal project that started summer 2023. I'm working on this project concurrently while taking 100 Days of SwiftUI and progressing with the app through my progression through the lessons. Current progress is a very slow because of school and work commitments

## Crocheto
Crocheto is a crochet app that allows crocheters to create, store, and share crochet patterns! 

### MVP and progress points
- Pattern builder (almost done)
- Project gallery (restarting)
- Pattern tracker (not started)
